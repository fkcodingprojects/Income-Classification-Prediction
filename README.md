# Predicting Income Classification using Various Machine Learning Models

This project aims to predict income classification based on various features using different machine learning models. We will explore and implement the following classification algorithms:

1. AdaBoost
2. K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
3. Logistic Regression
4. Naive Bayes
5. Neural Networks

## Data Preparation
The dataset for income classification is provided in the file `income_evaluation.csv`. We will perform data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Model Training and Evaluation
We will train each model using the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate classification metrics. Hyperparameter tuning will be employed to optimize the models and avoid overfitting.

## How to Contribute
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Access the respective directories for each machine learning model.
3. Review the Python scripts (e.g., `AdaBoost.py`, `K Nearest Neighbours.py`, etc.) containing the model implementation and evaluation code.
4. Share your feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improving the models through issues or pull requests.
5. Collaborate with us to enhance the predictive accuracy and usability of the models.

Please note that the success of these models depends on the quality of the data and the features used for classification. If you have access to additional or more relevant data for income prediction, consider updating the dataset and retraining the models for better classification results.
